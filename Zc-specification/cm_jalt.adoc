[NOTE]

  For this encoding to decode as _cm.jalt_, _index>=64_, otherwise it decodes as <<insns-cm_jt>>.

[NOTE]

  The equivalent encoding with bit[10]=1 is reserved to allow future expansion of the table index.

Description::

_cm.jalt_ reads an entry from the jump vector table in memory and jumps to the address that was read, linking to _ra_.

# InstMemory is byte indexed
