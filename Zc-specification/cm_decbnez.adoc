=== cm.decbnez: This is in the _development_ phase, for benchmarking and prototyping only

Synopsis::
Decrement and branch, 16-bit encoding

Mnemonic::
cm.decbnez _t0_, _offset_

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::

[NOTE]

  In the current proposal only t0 can be decremented, future versions may allow more registers

Description::
This instruction decrements _t0_, and increments the PC by the sign extended immediate if _t0_ is zero *after* the decrement.

Prerequisites::
C or Zca

32-bit equivalent::
None

Operation::
[source,sail]

//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

t0 = 5;
X(t0) = X(t0)-1;
if (X(t0)==0) PC+=sext(imm); else PC+=2;
