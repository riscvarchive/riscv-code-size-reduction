Description::
This instruction loads a halfword from the memory address formed by adding _rs1'_ to the zero extended immediate _uimm_. The resulting halfword is zero extended to XLEN bits and is written to _rd'_. 

[NOTE]
  _rd'_ and _rs1'_ are from the standard 8-register set x8-x15.

[NOTE]
  For an longer immediate with a 16-bit encoding see <<insns-cm_lhu>>.

Prerequisites::
None

32-bit equivalent::
<<insns-lhu>>

Operation::
[source,sail]

//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

X(rdc) = EXTZ(load_mem[X(rs1c)+EXTZ(uimm)][15..0]);
