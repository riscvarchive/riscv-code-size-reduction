    { bits:  6, name: 'mode',  attr: ['Jump Table Mode'] },

Description::

_JVT.base_ is a virtual address, whenever virtual memory is enabled.

Using _JVT.base[5:0]_ is implicitly zero, and is naturally aligned for all legal values of _XLEN_.

The memory pointed to by _JVT.base_ is treated as instruction memory for the purpose of executing table jump instructions.

_JVT.mode_ is a WARL field, so can only be programmed to modes which are implemented. Therefore the discovery mechanism is to 
attempt to program different modes and read back the values to see which are available. Jump table mode _must_ be implemented.

Architectural State::

JVT adds architectural state to the context, therefore must be saved/restored on context switches. 

Additional architectural state requires a state enable to be allocated. 
Accesses when the state is disabled will throw an illegal instruction exception.
The state enable is not specified in this document.
