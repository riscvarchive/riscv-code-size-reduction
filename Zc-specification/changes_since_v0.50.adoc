
There are many changes since v0.50.1, which has been used for toolchain, spike, qemu and the CV32E41P implementation.

The status of all of the instructions are in the tables. Note that _all_ subsets have been redefined.

== 16-bit Instructions

C.DECBNEZ - the encoding space for this has been used by all the CM.* instructions.
Therefore this instruction must be disabled in the compiler - unless an encoding is proposed.

C.NEG - this is not very useful and can be deleted.

== 32-bit Instructions

MULI - This is in custom-0, so can be kept unchanged. Early benchmarking results suggest it's not much use, and the encoding is expensive so it's unlikely to ever be included in an extension.

BEQI, BNEI - these fill in the 2 gaps in the BRANCH encoding group - these encodings have not been allocated to other instructions, so these can stay unchanged

DECBNEZ - this should be updated to match https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/Zce-release-candidate/Zcmd.pdf

LWGP, SWGP, LDGP, SDGP - these overlap with C.FLD, C.FSD

PUSH/POP/POPRET - delete all of these
