=== Zc* Overview

This document is in the ratified state. No changes are allowed. Any desired or needed changes can be the subject of a follow-on new extension. Ratified extensions are never revised.

Zc* is a group of extensions which define subsets of the existing C extension (Zca, Zcd, Zcf) and new extensions which only contain 16-bit encodings.

Zcm* all reuse the encodings for _c.fld_, _c.fsd_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsdsp_.

[#C]
=== C

The C extension is the superset of the following extensions:

* Zca
* Zcf if F is specified (RV32 only)
* Zcd if D is specified

As C defines the same instructions as Zca, Zcf and Zcd, the rule is that:

* C always implies Zca
* C+F implies Zcf (RV32 only)
* C+D implies Zcd

[#Zce]
=== Zce

The Zce extension is intended to be used for microcontrollers, and includes all relevant Zc extensions.

* Specifying Zce on RV32 without F includes Zca, Zcb, Zcmp, Zcmt
* Specifying Zce on RV32 with F includes Zca, Zcb, Zcmp, Zcmt _and_ Zcf
* Specifying Zce on RV64 always includes Zca, Zcb, Zcmp, Zcmt
** Zcf doesn't exist for RV64

Therefore common ISA strings can be updated as follows to include the relevant Zc extensions, for example:

* RV32IMC becomes RV32IM_Zce
* RV32IMCF becomes RV32IMF_Zce

[#misaC]
=== MISA.C

MISA.C is set if the following extensions are selected:

* Zca and not F
* Zca, Zcf and F is specified (RV32 only)
* Zca, Zcf and Zcd if D is specified (RV32 only)
** this configuration excludes Zcmp, Zcmt
* Zca, Zcd if D is specified (RV64 only)
** this configuration excludes Zcmp, Zcmt

[#Zca]
=== Zca

The Zca extension is added as way to refer to instructions in the C extension that do not include the floating-point loads and stores.

Therefore it _excluded_ all 16-bit floating point loads and stores: _c.flw_, _c.flwsp_, _c.fsw_, _c.fswsp_, _c.fld_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsd_, _c.fsdsp_.

NOTE: the C extension only includes F/D instructions when D and F are also specified

[#Zcf]
=== Zcf (RV32 only)

Zcf is the existing set of compressed single precision floating point loads and stores: _c.flw_, _c.flwsp_, _c.fsw_, _c.fswsp_.

Zcf is only relevant to RV32, it cannot be specified for RV64.

The Zcf extension depends on the <<Zca>> and F extensions.

[#Zcd]
=== Zcd 

Zcd is the existing set of compressed double precision floating point loads and stores: _c.fld_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsd_, _c.fsdsp_.

The Zcd extension depends on the <<Zca>> and D extensions.

[#Zcb]
=== Zcb

Zcb has simple code-size saving instructions which are easy to implement on all CPUs.

All proposed encodings are currently reserved for all architectures, and have no conflicts with any existing extensions.

NOTE: Zcb can be implemented on _any_ CPU as the instructions are 16-bit versions of existing 32-bit instructions from the application class profile.

The Zcb extension depends on the <<Zca>> extension.

As shown on the individual instruction pages, many of the instructions in Zcb depend upon another extension being implemented. For example, _c.mul_ is only implemented if M or Zmmul is implemented, and _c.sext.b_ is only implemented if Zbb is implemented.

The _c.mul_ encoding uses the CA register format along with other instructions such as _c.sub_, _c.xor_ etc. 

[NOTE]

  _c.sext.w_ is a pseudo-instruction for _c.addiw rd, 0_ (RV64)

[#Zcmp]
=== Zcmp

The Zcmp extension is a set of instructions which may be executed as a series of existing 32-bit RISC-V instructions.

This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
 which is included when C and D extensions are both present. 

NOTE: Zcmp is primarily targeted at embedded class CPUs due to implementation complexity. Additionally, it is not compatible with architecture class profiles.

The Zcmp extension depends on the <<Zca>> extension.

The PUSH/POP assembly syntax uses several variables, the meaning of which are:

* _reg_list_ is a list containing 1 to 13 registers (ra and 0 to 12 s registers)
** valid values: {ra}, {ra, s0}, {ra, s0-s1}, {ra, s0-s2}, ..., {ra, s0-s8}, {ra, s0-s9}, {ra, s0-s11}
** note that {ra, s0-s10} is _not_ valid, giving 12 lists not 13 for better encoding
* _stack_adj_ is the total size of the stack frame. 
** valid values vary with register list length and the specific encoding, see the instruction pages for details.

[#Zcmt]
=== Zcmt

Zcmt adds the table jump instructions and also adds the JVT CSR. The JVT CSR requires a 
state enable if Smstateen is implemented. See <<csrs-jvt>> for details.

This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
 which is included when C and D extensions are both present. 

NOTE: Zcmt is primarily targeted at embedded class CPUs due to implementation complexity. Additionally, it is not compatible with architecture class profiles.

The Zcmt extension depends on the <<Zca>> and Zicsr extensions.
