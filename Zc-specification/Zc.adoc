.Change history
[width="100%",options=header]
|====================================================================================
|Version  | change
|v1.0.0-RC5.2| Adjust the split so we have 240 cm.jalt and 16 cm.jt
|v1.0.0-RC5.1| Make cm.jt/cm.jalt only valid if JVT.mode=0, and allow different behaviour in the future if JVT.mode>0
|v1.0.0-RC5| Revert to cm.jt and cm.jalt encodings, to avoid toolchain and trace problems
|v1.0.0-RC4.1| Resolve typographical issues with the document only, no actual changes
|v1.0.0-RC4| Release candidate
|         | Remove Zcmb as benefit is low. Remove cm.jalt, read LSB of jump table entry to determine whether to link
|v0.70.5  | Resolve https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/issues/163 - jvt.base is WARL and fewer bits than the max can be implemented
|v0.70.4  | Clarified https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/issues/159 - Need Zbb and Zba for RV64 and M/ZMmul to get _all_ of Zcb
|         | Resolved https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/issues/161
|         | Resolved https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/issues/160 - Allocated Smstateen bit 2 and added the relevant text
|v0.70.3  | Added rule that Zcf and Zcmt imply Zca (this text was missing, this is not a spec change: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/pull/151)
|         | Added that Zcf is illegal for RV64, as it contains no instructions (clarification: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/issues/149)
|         | Added push/pop examples in the push/pop section
|v0.70.2  | Stylistic changes only, removing redundant text. 
|         | Corrected field names on JVT CSR diagram, and fixed synopsis for cm.mvsa01

=== Zc* Overview

This document is in the Frozen state. Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of a follow-on new extension. See https://riscv.org/spec-state

Zc* is a group of extensions which define subsets of the existing C extension (Zca, Zcd, Zcf) and new extensions which only contain 16-bit encodings.

Zcm* all reuse the encodings for _c.fld_, _c.fsd_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsdsp_.

[#Zca]
=== Zca

The Zca extension is added as way to refer to instructions in the C extension that do not include the floating-point loads and stores.

Therefore it _excluded_ all 16-bit floating point loads and stores: _c.flw_, _c.flwsp_, _c.fsw_, _c.fswsp_, _c.fld_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsd_, _c.fsdsp_.

NOTE: the the C extension only includes F/D instructions when D and F are also specified

[#Zcf]
=== Zcf (RV32 only)

Zcf is the existing set of compressed single precision floating point loads and stores: _c.flw_, _c.flwsp_, _c.fsw_, _c.fswsp_.

Zcf is only relevant to RV32, it cannot be specified for RV64.

Zcf requires the <<Zca>> extension.

[#Zcd]
=== Zcd 

Zcd is the existing set of compressed double precision floating point loads and stores: _c.fld_, _c.fldsp_, _c.fsd_, _c.fsdsp_.

Zcd requires the <<Zca>> extension.

[#Zcb]
=== Zcb

All proposed encodings are currently reserved for all architectures, and have no conflicts with any existing extensions.

Zcb requires the <<Zca>> extension.

As shown on the individual instruction pages, many of the instructions in Zcb depend upon another extension being implemented. For example, _c.mul_ is only implemented if M or Zmmul is implemented, and _c.sext.b_ is only implemented if Zbb is implemented.

The _c.mul_ encoding uses the CR register format along with other instructions such as _c.sub_, _c.xor_ etc. 

[NOTE]

  _c.sext.w_ is a pseudo-instruction for _c.addiw rd, 0_ (RV64)

[#Zcmp]
=== Zcmp

The Zcmp extension is a set of instuctions which may be executed as a series of existing 32-bit RISC-V instructions.

This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
 which is included when C and D extensions are both present. 

Zcmp requires the <<Zca>> extension.

The PUSH/POP assembly syntax uses several variables, the meaning of which are:

* _reg_list_ is a list containing 1 to 13 registers (ra and 0 to 12 s registers)
** valid values: {ra}, {ra, s0}, {ra, s0-s1}, {ra, s0-s2}, ..., {ra, s0-s8}, {ra, s0-s9}, {ra, s0-s11}
** note that {ra, s0-s10} is _not_ valid, giving 12 lists not 13 for better encoding
* _stack_adj_ is the total size of the stack frame. 
** valid values vary with register list length and the specific encoding, see the instruction pages for details.

[#Zcmpe]
=== Zcmpe

The Zcmpe extension offers EABI support for register mappings from <<Zcmp>> where the _x_ register mapping is different to the UABI. 

This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
 which is included when C and D extensions are both present. 

Zcmpe requires the <<Zca>> extension.

[NOTE]

  The EABI specification is not frozen so these instructions cannot yet be accurately specified.

[#Zcmt]
=== Zcmt

Zcmt adds a table jump instuction and also adds the JVT CSR. The JVT CSR requires a 
state enable if Smstateen is implemented. See <<csrs-jvt>> for details.

This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
 which is included when C and D extensions are both present. 

Zcmt requires the <<Zca>> extension.
