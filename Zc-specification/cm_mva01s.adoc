Assembly Syntax::

[source,sail]
--
cm.mva01s sreg1, sreg2
--

Description::
This instruction moves _sreg1_ into _a0_ and _sreg2_ into _a1_. 
The execution is atomic, so it is not possible to observe state where only one of _a0_ or _a1_ have been updated.

The encoding uses _sreg_ number specifiers instead of _xreg_ number specifiers to save encoding space. 
The mapping between them is specified in the pseudo-code below.

[NOTE]

  The _s_ register mapping is taken from the UABI, and may not match the currently unratified EABI. _cm.mva01s.e_ may be included in the future.

Prerequisites::
None

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.
if (RV32E && (sreg1>1 || sreg2>1)) {
  reserved();
}
xreg1 = {sreg1[2:1]>0,sreg1[2:1]==0,sreg1[2:0]};
xreg2 = {sreg2[2:1]>0,sreg2[2:1]==0,sreg2[2:0]};
X[10] = X[xreg1];
X[11] = X[xreg2];
