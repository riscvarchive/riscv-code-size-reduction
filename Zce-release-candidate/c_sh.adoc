Synopsis::
Store halfword, 16-bit encoding

Mnemonic::
c.sh _r2'_, _uimm_(_rs1'_)

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
    { bits:  2, name: 0x0, attr: ['C0'] },
    { bits:  3, name: 'rs2\'' },
    { bits:  2, name: 'uimm[2:1]' },
    { bits:  3, name: 'rs1\'' },
    { bits:  2, name: 'uimm[4:3]' },
    { bits:  1, name: 0x1 },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x5, attr: ['FUNCT3'] },
],config:{bits:16}}
....

[NOTE]

  _uimm[0] = 0_ so the offset is halfword aligned.

Description::
This instruction stores the least significant halfword of _rs2'_ to the memory address formed by adding _rs1'_ to the zero extended immediate _uimm_. 

[NOTE]
  _rd'_ and _rs1'_ are from the standard 8-register set x8-x15.

Prerequisites::
The C-extension. This encoding conflicts with the D-extension, but there is no conflict with Zdinx if double-precision arithmetic is required.

32-bit equivalent::
<<insns-sh>>

Operation::

--
//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

mem[X(rs1c)+EXTZ(uimm)][15..0] = X(rs2c)
