[#Zcee]
==== Zcee 0.53.3

This document is in the Stable state. Assume anything could still change, but limited change should be expected. For more information see:

The instructions in Zcee are all very simple and are 16-bit encodings of existing instructions, either from the I/E ISA or from Zbb.

All proposed encodings are currently reserved for all architectures, and have no conflicts with any existing extensions.

The _c.mul_ encoding uses the CR register format along with other instructions such as _c.sub_, _c.xor_ etc. 

[NOTE]

  _c.sext.w_ is a pseudo-instruction for _c.addiw rd, 0_ (RV64)
