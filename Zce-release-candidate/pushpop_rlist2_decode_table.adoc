  All ABI register mapping are for the UABI. An EABI version is planned once the EABI is frozen.

Field decoding::

The mapping from the _rlist2_ field in the encoding are as shown below.

|==================================================
|rlist2  |reg_list_1_4 2+|stack_adj_base
|        |             |RV32 | RV64 
|0       |ra           |16   | 16

|==================================================

_stack_adj_base_ is the minimum number of bytes, in multiples of 16-byte blocks, required to store the registers in _reg_list_1_4_. 

_spimm_ is the number of additional 16-byte blocks allocated for the stack frame.

The total stack adjustment is calculated as shown.
