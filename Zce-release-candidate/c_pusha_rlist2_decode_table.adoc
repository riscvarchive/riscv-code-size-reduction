Field decoding::

The mapping from the _rlist2_ field in the encoding are as shown below.

_stack_adj_base_ is defined to allocate the minimum number of 16-byte blocks of stack space to cover the registers in _reg_list_2_4_. 

_spimm_ is used to allocate extra stack space in 16-byte blocks. 

The total stack adjustment is calculated as shown.
