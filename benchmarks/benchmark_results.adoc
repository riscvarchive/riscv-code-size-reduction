## Zce Code saving estimation criteria 


# Benchmarking Background: 
This document present benchmarking results for Zce extension, baseline files were compiled using https://buildbot.embecosm.com/job/riscv32-gcc-ubuntu1804-release/5/artifact/riscv32-embecosm-ubuntu1804-gcc10.2.0-r4.tar.gz[gcc10.2.0-r4] with -Os and -msave-restore unless otherwise specified. All results are generated from static analysis, and
file sizes are calculated based on parsed instruction sizes of the ELF files, and the optimized sizes are calculated based on parsed instruction with relevant Zce instructions. 


# Zcec Subset: 

## C.TBLJAL
.. Find all (JAL, JALR, J and JR) instructions to be considered for replacement.
.. Remove entries that we won't gain any code saving from substituting, When number of identical (JAL or J) <  3.
.. Change the weight of JALR and JR entries to 3*Count (This would give them priority in selection, since their replacement results in more code saving).
.. Get the top 512 entries xref:#Shorter table length for TBLJAL[here].
 Replace the entries in instruction record with the TBLJAL entries, and calculate the gains and compensate for the table size.
