Welcome to the RISC-V Code Size Reduction Group
------------------------------------------------


This will be the home for the all of the code size reduction proposals, analysis, results etc.

Currently I have documented the [Huawei Custom Extension](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/README.md) for reducing code size, which is already in silicon. I'd like to use this as the basis for a future RISC-V code size reduction extension.
