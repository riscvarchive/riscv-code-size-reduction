_If you can't measure it you can't improve it_

This is the release area for the code size reduction extension:

- [Zc ISA proposal](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/releases)

This is the the lastest spec:

- [Zc-specification](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/tree/master/Zc-specification)

GCC toolchains:

- [Build from sources](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/tree/main/toolchain)
- [Prebuilt](https://github.com/Liaoshihua/code-size-reduction-gnu-toolchain)

For details of analysing the `Zc` code-size reduction extensions against your ELF file look here
